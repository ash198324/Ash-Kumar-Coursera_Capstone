            "source": "# **Capstone Project**\n\n## IBM Applied Data Science Capstone\n\n### *\"Opening a New Gym in the city of Hayward, California.\"*\n\n###### By: Ashneel Kumar\n###### February 2020\n    \n### **Intro:**\n    \nAs much as we'd like to believe that chocolate cake and ice cream are the elixir for a long and healthy life, we know that's not the case. We also know that a regular exercise routine is one of the surest paths to a longer and healthier life.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderately intense aerobic exercise every week \u2013 but less than half of all Americans do so. And for the millions of people who would like to do better, this is often the time of year to consider joining a gym. We can all find lots of excuses for not getting our bodies in motion, but there's an equally compelling list of reasons why we should do so.\n\nWhether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, tone up or improve your overall health, you\u2019ll have to start somewhere and that\u2019s the No. 1 reason people of all fitness levels pony up the bucks and decide to join a conveniently located gym.\n    \n### **Business Problem:**\n    \nThe main focus of this project is to analyze and pick a prime location in the city of Hayward, California to open a brand new gym. Using data science methodology as the stepping stone with machine learning method and techniques like clustering to answer this business question:\n\n*Where would you recommend an investor/developer in the city of Hayward to open a brand new Gym?*\n\n\n### **Data to solve this business problem:**\n\n1. List of all the gyms in the city of Hayward CA\n\n2. Latitude and longitude coordinates of those gyms, which is a requirement in order to plot the maps and get venue data etc.\n\n3. Data involving all the gyms in the city of Hayward. The data will be used to preform clustering on the neighborhood.\n\n### **Data Source & Web-scraping:**\n\nThe data source will be this Wikipedia page:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighborhoods_in_Hayward,_California\n\nUsing web scraping techniques to extract data from this Wikipedia page, in Jupyter Notebook using the python language and beautifulsoup packages as well as Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude coordinate of the neighborhood in the city of Hayward California.\n\nAlso using Foursquare API to get all the data necessary regarding \u201cGyms\u201d for those neighborhoods to solve the business problem.\n\nAt display will be a lot off data science skills such as, web scraping (Wikipedia), Foursquare (API), data cleaning, data wrangling, machine learning technique (K-Means Clustering) and visualization using (Folium).\n\n### **Target Audience:**\n\nThis project is useful for investors, developers or entrepreneurs.\n",
